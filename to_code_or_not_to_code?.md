# To Code or Not to Code?


In a recent YouTube video produced by Code.org, President Obama, encourages young people to spend some time this week learning how to code.  He remarks, "Don't just download the latest app, help design it."  With these words, Obama joins the ranks of a number of other entrepreneurs and celebrities encouraging computer science to play a bigger role in our nation's education system.  The idea seems to be that by learning how to write code, we will become masters over our technologies, rather than simply consumers of it.

As someone who recently learned how to build web applications in an intensive twelve-week long boot-camp, I agree that gaining computer literacy beyond basic use has changed my life.  When I graduated college with a liberal arts degree, I felt frustrated by my lack of practical skills and found it difficult to secure a fulfilling job that paid the bills. Taking a bootcamp reversed my trajectory - I enjoy the variety of challenges in writing code and work at a place with people like myself. 


 However, the notion that coding is the literacy of today, as expressed by people like Obama, is a tentative one.  For one thing, I would not have even begun to grasp the ideas which drive good programming skills without having a solid background in the liberal arts.  Steve Klabnik gave a really good talk on Object Oriented Programming and its relationship to Philosophy.
 
Gaining real literacy, through writing, developing arguments, and thinking critically about issues, should not be sacrificed for the sake of computer literacy.  Overly stressing the importance of learning to code, at the expense of other necessary skills, ignores the importance of a well-rounded education in developing programmers who do more than just program - which is what we really want.

Let me touch on that point a little - programmers who do more than just program.  I think that is where the beauty of knowing how to code becomes apparent - in our ability to take that new skill and apply it to other things we are interested in.

My background was in music composition - and my first experience in coding was to write computer algorithms which generated random musical sounds. These computer compositions, which were really novice experiments, became the lens through which I eventually understood and came to appreciate programming.  In fact, I underestimated just how similar music composition is to programming in a lot of ways: both involve creating a series of conditions, one for a performer, the other for a computer.  


Ideally, learning to code ought to exist in a continuum with the development of other essential skills.
